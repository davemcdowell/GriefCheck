# GriefCheck
 Left 4 Dead 2 server plugin for checking if players are known griefers.

# How it Works
Uses an http request to build a list of griefers (https://github.com/davemcdowell/L4D2-Griefers/blob/main/ingest) to cross-reference players Steam IDs against a list of known griefers IDs.

# Legal Stuff
Please note there is no breach of privacy of any 'griefer'. These IDs are public information - using them in this manner is completely OK and up-to server operators.
I take no responsibility for any damage, or whatever else may happen using this. Other than ridding your server of griefers ;p
