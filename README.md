# Grief Check
 Left 4 Dead 2 server plugin for checking if players are known griefers.

# How it Works
Uses a http request to build a list of griefers (https://github.com/davemcdowell/L4D2-Griefers/blob/main/ingest) to cross-reference players Steam IDs against a list of known griefer IDs.

# Legal Stuff
Please note there is no breach of privacy of any 'griefer'. These IDs are public information â€” using them in this manner is completely Ok and up-to server operators.
I take no responsibility for any damage, or whatever else may happen using this; Other than ridding your server of griefers of course ;p
